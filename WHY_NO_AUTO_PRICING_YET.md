# Why Estimatix Doesn't Auto-Price Your Bids (Yet)

## Your Prices Are Your Business

In construction, a bid isn't just a number—it's your reputation.

Price too high, you lose the job. Price too low, you lose money. Get it wrong repeatedly, you lose the business.

We built Estimatix because we respect that reality. And that's exactly why we're not rushing to guess your prices for you.

## The Problem With Early AI Pricing

You've probably seen tools that promise to "auto-price" your estimates. They pull numbers from national databases, average out costs across regions, and spit out a price that looks reasonable on paper.

Here's what actually happens:

- **Generic data doesn't know your market.** A framing cost in Austin isn't the same as in rural Vermont.
- **Averages hide the details.** Your quality tier, your crew efficiency, your supplier relationships—none of that shows up in a database average.
- **Wrong suggestions create bad habits.** If you start accepting AI prices without thinking, you stop estimating. And when the AI is wrong, you eat the loss.

We've seen contractors burned by tools that confidently suggested the wrong price. That's not a tool—that's a liability.

## Our Philosophy: You Lead, We Learn

Estimatix takes a different approach.

**You control the prices.**  
Every number in your estimate is yours. You enter it, you own it, you stand behind it. We don't override your judgment or nudge you toward some "suggested" price.

**We learn from real jobs.**  
When you finalize a bid, sign a contract, or close out a project, we quietly capture what actually happened. Not to second-guess you—but to build a picture of what real pricing looks like in your world.

**Accuracy improves over time.**  
The more you use Estimatix, the smarter it gets about *your* pricing patterns. Not generic industry data. Yours.

This isn't about being slow. It's about being right.

## What You Get Right Now

While we're building toward smarter pricing, Estimatix already saves you hours:

### Speed
- Record a walkthrough on your phone → get a draft estimate in minutes
- Voice-to-estimate means less time typing, more time thinking

### Organization
- Every project in one place: files, estimates, proposals, contracts
- Room-by-room scoping that matches how you actually work
- Cost codes that organize your line items automatically

### Professional Documents
- Generate proposals that look polished, not thrown together
- Create contracts from your estimates with one click
- Invoice against completed work without re-entering data

You're not waiting for the "good version" of Estimatix. This is the real thing—built for contractors who want control over their bids and their business.

## What's Coming

We're working toward a future where Estimatix can offer genuinely useful pricing intelligence:

- **Personalized suggestions** based on your own history—not generic databases
- **Regional awareness** that reflects what contractors in your area actually charge
- **Accuracy tracking** so you can see how your estimates compare to your actual costs

But here's the key: these features will be built on real data from real jobs. Not assumptions. Not industry averages. The pricing intelligence you'll eventually see will be earned—by you, through your work.

When we turn on suggestions, they'll be worth listening to.

## The Bottom Line

We could have shipped auto-pricing on day one. It would have been easy to pull numbers from somewhere and call it "AI-powered."

But that's not the tool you need.

You need a tool that respects your expertise, saves you time on the busywork, and gets smarter the more you use it—without ever putting your bids at risk.

That's what we're building.

**Your prices. Your reputation. Your control.**
